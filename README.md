# Discussion-of-Fat-Tail-Models-in-Volatility-Estimation

After the 2008 financial crisis, it seems that the existence of fat tails in the literature abounds in models that can account for fat tails, but asset returns should consider all possible stylized facts related to statistics. The best approach is to choose an extended model that includes the normal distribution as a special case and then test its performance on the real data. The more theoretical question of whether the chosen model is the best one among other models when it comes to better performance in common financial calculations and fits the daily percentage returns of the S&P 500. We approached our goal using Whole Data Modelling of the t-distribution, as well as extreme scenario models of the Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV). We then used the GARCH model to build the volatility forecast model with t-distribution. After visualizing and evaluating the forecasting result of t-distribution, we applied normal distribution on the forecasting model too to make a comparison between these two distributions. The result led our projectâ€™s proposal student t distribution is better for financial calculations so that the investment choices take the expectation of more severe events into account.
